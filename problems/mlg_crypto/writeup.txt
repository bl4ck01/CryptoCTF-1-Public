The body of the message contains about two dozen distinct words. A word frequency analysis reveals results approximately consistent with those of a character frequency analysis of a typical substitution cipher. Assume that BREAK is a space, and decipher the message as you would an average substitution cipher. One way of doing this is by substituting a distinct character in for each letter (see sol.py) and using an online ciphercracker like quipqiup.
