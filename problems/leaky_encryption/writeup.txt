The math might look scary, but the cryptosystem is actually very easy to break using a known ciphertext attack.
The most important part is to recognize that this is an implementation of the Rabin cryptosystem.
Looking at the wikipedia page we see that if someone has both r and s, he can find the factorization of N because gcd(|r-s|,N) is either equal to p or q
We know the possible decryptions for "Hello World!", so we know both r and s!
We simply compute p = gcd(|r-s|,N), q=N/p, and then look at the decryption possibilities of decrypt(encrypted_flag, p,q)
The flag will be one of the possibilities, flag{ch0sen_c1phert3xt_att4ckz_r_ez}
