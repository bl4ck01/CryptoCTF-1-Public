  Bro, these pixels are like totally tripping me out. 
  I stand back, bro, and I swear I can see zig-zaggy 
  patterns. All the pretty pixels are, like, bleeding 
  into the other pixels, bro, it's crazy. Like they're 
  telling their father pixels exactly how much they've 
  grown. So, so radical, bro.<br />

  Bro, I swear, it's not how the pixels are as pixels, 
  bro, it's how they relate to one another. Trippy.
