  This year, a very renowned cryptographer manager 
  to win a literary prize. However, the things he 
  writes make next to no sense. An excerpt from 
  the novel he wrote is attached. We know there's
  a flag. Figure out what he thinks of his own 
  work.<br />

hint: Of course it doesn't make sense; the author was downright nuts.
