Java's Random class uses a PRNG. With enough outputs, it is possible to recover the internal state of a PRNG and predict future outputs.
We use the logged integers, and a library such as foresight (https://github.com/ALSchwalm/foresight) to predict the values that the flag will be XOR'ed with.
we can then simply undo the XOR'ing and recover the flag
