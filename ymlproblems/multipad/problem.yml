  Howard made some OTP problems, but he 
  decided they were too easy, so he made 
  another. But he's an idiot, and this 
  one's pad has been used like six billion 
  freaking times. You can probably break it, 
  but maybe not what it was used on.<br />

hint: Howard is an idiot. This isn't even an OTP. OTPs use XOR.
