  Once upon a time, PlaidCTF happened, 
  and they had a beautiful website. 
  However, there was one CTFer who became 
  exasperated at the design of their 
  homepage. He made these problems to 
  express his rage at being unable to 
  find things he needs. Solve all four 
  parts to get the flag.<br />

  Don't read too much into the description. 
  Just find the flag.
