The image depicts a formula used frequently in middle school mathematics - the logarithmic change of base formula. We will be changing bases! Since the problem text screams 8, we will first try Octal:

Output: NjY2YzYxNjc3YjYyNjE3MzY5NjM2MTZjNmM3OTVmNjI3MjYxNmU2NDZmNmU1ZjZkNjM2MzYxNzI3NDZlNjU3OTdk

With a long gaze, we can assume this to be base 64, so let's translate:
