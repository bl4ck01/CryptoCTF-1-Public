A major musical scale contains seven notes, and looking at the key signature (C#, F#, and G#) we can see that this piece is written in A major. Let 0 equal A, 1 equal B, 2 equal C#, etc, all the way up the scale. Each measure, then, can be represented as three digits - a number in base 7, or the number of notes in the musical scale. Cast the value of each measure to ASCII and discover the flag.
